# Subnet Mask Calculator

A calculator that allows you to input a network class or IP address and calculates the subnet mask

### Compile & Run (Linux)

(Might work on mac too idk. On Windows, you'll probably have to generate a VS project using CMake - No idea how you'd do that though)

In the repo folder (same folder as CMakeLists.txt) make a directory 'build' and navigate to it.

Then run these commands:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```
And to run:
```bash
./SubnetMasksExe
```
